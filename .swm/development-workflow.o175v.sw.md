## Development

<br/>

Run `yarn dev` to open Vuepress, the documentation platform we use to create a catalog of the components, as well as the design tokens (fonts, colors, spacings etc).

<br/>

To change an existing component, open it's `.md` files inside [[sym:./docs/components(414a9d81-f005-4e53-81f4-e948763c280d)]] and edit the file.

<br/>

When creating a new component, create a new `.md` inside [[sym:./docs/components(414a9d81-f005-4e53-81f4-e948763c280d)]] and add examples for all the possible variants of the component (see below).

<br/>

## Documentation

<br/>

Make sure to document the possible variants of a component, or any design token, using the correct markdown file inside the [[sym:./docs(4c6086a6-819c-4a92-a6ed-e032e1348db8)]] folder. Using the `::: demo` markdown container, you can easily create a live example of the component, while showing the code snippet you used for that example:

<br/>

<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 游늯 docs/components/action.md
```markdown
游릴 13     ## Primary
游릴 14     
游릴 15     ::: demo
游릴 16     <Action>Primary Default</Action>
游릴 17     :::
```

<br/>

You can also add a description for the component, or any other relevant information.

<br/>

## Testing

<br/>

We use Vitest and Vue Test Utils for component and unit testing. Make sure to cover your changes with tests.

<br/>

To run all test, run `yarn test`

<br/>

## Committing Your Changes

<br/>

To commit your changes you can run `yarn commit` and follow the wizard, or alternatively write a commit in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. Pay attention to the type of the commit as it will or will not trigger a new version release.

<br/>

You can also use the VS Code extension or IntelliJ

<br/>

Read more about Conventional commits and the automated release in [Release Workflow](release-workflow.lnjwx.sw.md).

<br/>

## Release

<br/>

If a new version is triggered, the release workflow will run in GitHub Action. When it's finished, Semantic Release will add a message to the PR/s who are included in this release:
