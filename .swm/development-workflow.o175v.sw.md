## Development

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

Run `yarn dev` to open Vuepress, the documentation platform we use to create a catalog of the components, as well as the design tokens (fonts, colors, spacings etc).

To change an existing component, open it's `.md` files inside `游늯 docs/components` and edit the file.

When creating a new component, create a new `.md` inside `游늯 docs/components` and add examples for all the possible variants of the component (see below).

## Documentation

Make sure to document the possible variants of a component, or any design token, using the correct markdown file inside the `游늯 docs` folder. Using the `::: demo` markdown container, you can easily create a live example of the component, while showing the code snippet you used for that example:

<br/>

<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 游늯 docs/components/action.md
```markdown
游릴 13     ## Primary
游릴 14     
游릴 15     ::: demo
游릴 16     <Action>Primary Default</Action>
游릴 17     :::
```

<br/>

You can also add a description for the component, or any other relevant information.

## Testing

We use Vitest and Vue Test Utils for component and unit testing. Make sure to cover your changes with tests.

To run all test, run `yarn test`

## Committing Your Changes

**IMPORTANT: Before committing your changes, make sure to read this: [Release Workflow](release-workflow.lnjwx.sw.md).**

To commit your changes you can run `yarn commit` and follow the wizard, or alternatively write a commit in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. Pay attention to the type of the commit as it will or will not trigger a new version release.

You can also use the VS Code extension or IntelliJ

Read more about Conventional commits and the automated release in [Release Workflow](release-workflow.lnjwx.sw.md).

## Release

If a new version is triggered, the release workflow will run in GitHub Action. When it's finished, Semantic Release will add a message to the PR/s who are included in this release:

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2Fpw8tVz0TAgLaoHABDlsw%2F2bc25b5d-0d79-43ab-9714-f5d7b4ccd520.png?alt=media&token=b9dac950-10ab-407a-bab0-787e6a16e414" style="width:'50%'"/></div>

Also, the `游늯 CHANGELOG.md` will be updated and the new version will be updated in [[sym:././package.json(e626242b-9dd2-4b03-b376-44dfc8601094)]].
